# prev hash
# hash

# immutable of attack 
# hash cryptography(sha 256) [fingure print]
  ##### 1. one way
  ##### 2. Deterministic
  ##### 3. Fast Computation
  ##### 4. Avalance effects
  ##### 5. collision resistance disallow the attacker to fordge the document
# distributed p2p network
  ##### 1. replicated in all node 
  ##### 2. added block to all node 
  ##### 3. majority wins 
  ##### 4. Two-layer of secutity
  ##### 5. untrusting --> trust
# mining
  ##### 1. blocknumber
  ##### 2. data
  ##### 3. previous hash
  ##### 4. hash [block_num+data+previous_hash+nonce]
  ##### 5. nonce
  ##### 6. minier task is to manipulate the nonce to get a hash that satisfy certain condition
  ##### 7. hash is a number   
  ##### 8. condtion hash is less than specfic target
  ##### 9. express the target by set of leading zeros
  ##### 10. come up with hash that is less than target
  ##### 11. make mining very difficult
  ##### 12. avanlance effect
  ##### 13. no reveser engineering
  ##### 14. mining
# consensus protocol
  ##### 1. two node comeup with new block
  ##### 2. prrof of work, proof of stake
  ##### 3. miner cheating  
  ##### 4. Hard to solve - Easy to verify 
  ##### 5. checking in all node 
  ##### 6. longer chain wins
  ##### 7. orphaned blocks
#### cryptographically linked together
